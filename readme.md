# Massdrop CTRL Keyboard Splash LED

adding LED Splash effect with the provided QMK software.

## What's different (or added) from the forked project: (root as project folder)
`+ /hid_listen.exe`

`+ /massdrop_ctrl_default.bin`

`+ /massdrop_ctrl_valen214.bin`

`+ /massdrop_ctrl_valen_activate_on_press.bin`

`+ /mdloader_linux`

`+ /mdloader_windows.exe`

`+ /qmktoolbox.exe`

`+ /.build/*`

`+ /keyboards/massdrop/ctrl/keymaps/valen214/*`

`+ /keyboards/massdrop/ctrl/keymaps/valen214_activate_on_press/*`


other changes are unintentional or not important.

## How to use:
### Build yourself
1) have everything set up (to a point where you can compile and flash driver)
2) `make massdrop/ctrl:valen214`
3) `./.build/mdloader_windows.exe --first --download massdrop_ctrl_valen214.bin --restart`
(I am sorry that I am using MSYS)
4) `Fn + B` or use the pin to reset
5) Done

### qmk toolbox
1) bin file inside /.build/

fullstop.

### (Currently Available) Settings
`Fn + P`: Toggle background and wave on/off


## Implementation:
**basically all changes happen only in `/keyboards/massdrop/ctrl/keymaps/valen214/keymap.c`:**
Inspired by [LastContinue's Post](https://www.massdrop.com/talk/9382/how-to-configure-your-ctrl-keyboard/2201429),
by abusing `led_instructions_t` to set the led of each individual key only in `keymap.c` (It is understood to be very inefficient, but one benefit of this is being more prone to future changes (if any, ok I know there is very little) and slightly more portable (more below)).

one core function is `unsigned char ktli(uint16_t keycode);`
where you input the keycode to return the id of the led light that key correspond to (as mentioned in the post).
Therefore, ideally, changing this function alone is enough to use the code on other QMK 87 keyboards (assumption is made that the parent project from massdrop is identical to QMK's, but that's not true, I am unable to compile the code with QMK's firmware fork, didn't bother to debug).

## Known bugs/limitations
~~- double click a key will reset the original "wave front"~~
- not really appealing when typing in a fast speed (I don't have a led keyboards that have splashing so I don't know what the effect should have looked like. I am just doing this by imagination. # It is easy to add limit to distance traveled by the light, I would try if it has any positive effect)
~~- function keys (F1 - F12) and navigation keys (Ins, Home) are not working. (funtion keys are little bit tricky, but navigation keys are ~~easily implemented by updating `KEY_POSITION_MAP`)

This project is just for fun and please don't be serious ðŸ˜†.
